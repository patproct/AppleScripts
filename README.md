AppleScripts
============

Some of my personal AppleScripts for opening live streams.

* [WFIU][wfiu] - Indiana Public Media Radio
* [WIUX][wiux] - Indiana University Student Radio
* [NASA TV][nasa] - NASA TV in HD
* [WFYI][wfyi] - HD1 channel only, HD2 coming soon

Support for WFYI HD1 has been temporarily added to the IU Radio script until HD2 can be resolved.
